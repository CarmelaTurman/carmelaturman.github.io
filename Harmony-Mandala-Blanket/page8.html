      <h2>Round 51</h2>
      <p>When working into the top of the popcorn stitches you will be working into the first dc of the popcorn, through which you pulled the last dc of the popcorn. You will find this stitch immediately to the right of the popcorn (left if you are left-handed).</p>
      <p>If you are using the same colour, ch 3 (counts as hdc + ch-1). Hdc in the same stitch. This is your first corner made.</p>
      <p>If you are using a new colour, join your yarn by making a standing half-double crochet in the same st as the sl st join. (Ch 1, hdc) in the same stitch. This is your first corner made.</p>
      <p>Short Side: Sc in the next ch-1 space. Skip the first (hidden) stitch. Sc in the next 15 sts. Last sc should fall in the sc made into the hdc from Round 49. Fpdc around the hdc between the leaves from Round 49. Sc in the next 15 sts. Skip last st and sc in the next ch-1 space.</p>
      <p>Long Side: (Hdc, ch 1, hdc) in the next (hidden) stitch. Make a fptr around the fptr from Round 49. Skip the next 2 sts. Hdc in the next 4 sts. The second hdc should fall in the top of the popcorn stitch.</p>
      <p>(Fptr around next fptr from Round 49, skip next st of Round 50, hdc in next 2 sts, Fptr around next fptr from Round 49, skip next st of Round 50, hdc in next 4 sts) 8 times.</p>
      <p>Fptr around the next fptr from Round 49, skip next st of Round 50. (Hdc, ch 1, hdc) in the next st (first sc of previous corner). Repeat 3 more times, omitting the last corner. Join to top of beginning ch-3 (or standing hdc) with sl st.</p>
      <p><strong>Stitch Counts:</strong> Total: 428 sts, 8 ch-1 corner spaces {128 sc, 224 hdc, 4 fpdc, 72 fptr}. Short Side: 35 sts {32 sc, 2 hdc, 1 fpdc}. Long Side: 72 sts {54 hdc, 18 fptr}.</p>
