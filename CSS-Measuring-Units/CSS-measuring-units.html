			<h3>
				<p> Question: Explain the difference between absolute and relative CSS length units</p>
			</h3>
			<p>Answer:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Non-semantic tags don't inherently describe the content they contain.
					They provide no information about the meaning or structure of the content enclosed within them.</li>

				<li>Semantic tags clearly define the content’s purpose and structure.
					They provide meaning to the content enclosed, both to the browser and to developers.</li>

				<li> Relative length units specify a length in relation to another length
					property, which makes them ideal for building responsive and accessible websites. </li>
			</ul>

			<h2> Description of units </h2>

			<h3> px, pt</h3>
			<p>Pixels
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li> Pixels, which are short for "picture element," are the smallest units seen in digital displays or
					images. One point of color is represented by a small square or dot.
					Together with other pixels, they create the pictures we see on devices like televisions, cellphones,
					and computer monitors. </li>

				<li> px (pixels): Represents a single dot on the screen, but is only "absolute" in a technical sense.
					Its size varies depending on
					the device's DPI and resolution, allowing it to adapt somewhat. </li>

				<li> px (Pixels): Historically, a pixel was a single dot on a computer screen. In modern web design, a
					CSS pixel (px) is an abstract unit that serves as a
					reference point for other absolute units and is calibrated to look roughly the same size across
					different devices and viewing distances.
					It is still the most commonly used unit for web design elements that require fixed, precise control,

			<p>Points</p>
					<ul>
						<li> pt (points): Defined as 1/72 of an inch and is primarily used for print stylesheets.
							in (inches), cm (centimeters), mm (millimeters): Represent their physical counterparts
							and are useful for styling content intended for print </li>

						<li> pt (Points): Defined as 1/72 of an inch and is an absolute unit of measurement inherited
							from traditional print typography. It should be avoided for screen layouts due to its fixed,
							non-scaling nature and is only suitable for print-specific stylesheets. </li>

					</ul>

			<h3> em and rem </h3>

			<p>em and rem are font-relative units frequently used to create scalable and accessible layouts. </p>

			<p> em </p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<This unit is in relation to the closest parent element's font size. Applying em units and having
						nested items can have a compounding impact that is unpredictable. A nested < div>
						with font-size: 1.5em, for instance,
						will inherit a size that is 150% of the font size of its parent.When scaling components
						proportionately,
						this behavior is helpful.
				</li>

				<li> Standing for "root em," this unit is relative to the font size of the document's root element
					(the
					html tag).This provides consistent sizing throughout a webpage, as all rem units refer to the
					same base value.
					This predictability is highly beneficial for responsive typography and simplifies scaling. For
					accessibility, using rem for font sizes allows users to scale text by changing their browser's
					default font settings, while
					rem values for margins and padding will scale proportionally. </li>

				<p>rem</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The rem unit, which stands for "root em," creates a sizing reference in relation to the root
						HTML element's font size.
						Because each rem unit is linked to a single base value, this uniformity guarantees
						consistent scaling throughout a webpage.
						This feature generally streamlines scaling procedures and is very beneficial for responsive
						typography. Because rem is used
						for font sizes, users can change the default font settings in their browser to change the
						size of text. Moreover, rem values
						help ensure that padding and margins scale proportionately.</li>

					<li> Unlike em units, which are relative to the font-size of their parent element, rem units
						consistently refer to the font-size
						of the <html> element. By default, browsers set the <html> element's font-size to 16px,
						meaning 1rem typically equals 16px unless altered.
						This consistent reference point makes rem units highly effective for scalable and accessible
						layouts. Changing the <html> element's font-size
						will proportionally scale all elements defined with rem units across the document. This is
						particularly beneficial for responsive design,
						enabling typography and spacing adjustments for different screen sizes via media queries and
						root font size changes, and for accessibility,
						allowing users to control website scale through their browser's default font size settings,
						which rem units will honor. The rem unit can be
						applied to various CSS properties, including font-size, padding, margin, width, and height,
						ensuring uniform scaling relative to the root font size. </li>

				</ul>

			<h3>vmin; vmax </h3>

			<p></p> These units are relative to the size of the viewport (the browser window) and are essential for
			creating
			designs that adapt to different screen sizes. </h2>


			<p>vmin (Viewport Minimum) </p>
			<ul>
				<li> The CSS unit 'vmin', which is 1%, represents the viewport's smaller dimension (width or
					height).
					Adaptive sizing is made easier by this unit, which ensures that elements scale proportionately
					within
					viewport constraints. For instance, the width of a viewport that is 700 pixels wide by 900
					pixels tall
					shows that 1vmin is equivalent to 7 pixels. Vmin is especially helpful for mobile-first designs
					and for
					elements like headers and footers that require consistent relative sizing to prevent excessive
					negative
					space on smaller screens.represents 1% of the viewport's smaller dimensions, which can be either
					width or
					height.It is helpful for producing a square element that, even when the viewport is resized,
					remains visible
					on the screen at all times without spilling over.
				</li>

				<p>vmax (Viewport Maximum)</p>


				<li> The context-dependent term "max (Viewport Maximum)" can refer to either the `maximum-scale`
					attribute
					in an
					HTML viewport meta tag or the CSS unit `vmax`. A relative CSS measurement, the `vmax` unit is
					1/100th of
					the browser's
					viewport's larger dimension; for instance, 10vmax in a 1000px by 1200px viewport is 120px. With
					values
					like `maximum-scale=2.0`
					permitting twofold zoom and `maximum-scale=1.0` prohibiting any zoom, the `maximum-scale` attribute,
					on
					the other hand, restricts user zoom on a webpage.
					In order to differentiate between CSS styling and mobile device interaction controls, context is
					essential.
