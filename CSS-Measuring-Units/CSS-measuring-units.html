			<p> Question: Explain the difference between absolute and relative CSS length units</p>
			<p>Answer:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Non-semantic tags don't inherently describe the content they contain.
					They provide no information about the meaning or structure of the content enclosed within them.</li>

				<li>Semantic tags clearly define the content’s purpose and structure.
					They provide meaning to the content enclosed, both to the browser and to developers.</li>

				<li> Relative length units specify a length in relation to another length
					property, which makes them ideal for building responsive and accessible websites. </li>
			</ul>

		<h2> Description of units </h2>

<h3>Pixels </h3>
			<ul>
				<li> Pixels, which are short for "picture element," are the smallest units seen in digital displays or
					images. One point of color is represented by a small square or dot.
					Together with other pixels, they create the pictures we see on devices like televisions, cellphones,
					and computer monitors. </li>

				<li> px (pixels): Represents a single dot on the screen, but is only "absolute" in a technical sense.
					Its size varies depending on
					the device's DPI and resolution, allowing it to adapt somewhat. </li>

				<li> px (Pixels): Historically, a pixel was a single dot on a computer screen. In modern web design, a
					CSS pixel (px) is an abstract unit that serves as a
					reference point for other absolute units and is calibrated to look roughly the same size across
					different devices and viewing distances.
					It is still the most commonly used unit for web design elements that require fixed, precise control,
		<h3> Points</h3>
			<ul>
				<li> pt (points): Defined as 1/72 of an inch and is primarily used for print stylesheets.
					in (inches), cm (centimeters), mm (millimeters): Represent their physical counterparts
					and are useful for styling content intended for print </li>

				<li> pt (Points): Defined as 1/72 of an inch and is an absolute unit of measurement inherited
					from traditional print typography. It should be avoided for screen layouts due to its fixed,
					non-scaling nature and is only suitable for print-specific stylesheets. </li>

			</ul>			such as borders or small icons. </li>

					<h2> Points</h2>

			</ul>
			</ul>

		<h3> em and rem </h3>
		<p>em and rem are font-relative units frequently used to create scalable and accessible layouts. </p>
		<ul>
			<l1> em: This unit is relative to the font size of its nearest parent element. If you have nested elements
				and apply em units,
				the effect can compound, which can be difficult to predict. For example, a nested <div> with font-size:
				1.5em will inherit a size that is 150% of its parent's font size.
				This behavior is useful for scaling components proportionally. </l1>

			<li> Standing for "root em," this unit is relative to the font size of the document's root element (the
				html tag).
				This provides consistent sizing throughout a webpage, as all rem units refer to the same base value.
				This predictability is highly beneficial for responsive typography and simplifies scaling. For
				accessibility, using rem for font sizes allows users to scale text by changing their browser's default font settings, while
				rem values for margins and padding will scale proportionally. </li>

		</ul>

		<h3>vmin; vmax </h3>
		<p></p> These units are relative to the size of the viewport (the browser window) and are essential for creating
		designs that adapt to different screen sizes. </h2>


		<ul>
			<li> vmin (Viewport Minimum): Represents 1% of the smaller dimension of the viewport (either height or
				width).
				It is useful for creating a square element that is always visible on the screen without overflowing,
				even when the viewport is resized. </li>

			<li>vmax (Viewport Maximum): Represents 1% of the larger dimension of the viewport. </li>
		</ul>
