		<p> Question: Explain the difference between absolute and relative CSS length units</p>
		</h3>
		<p>Answer:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Non-semantic tags don't inherently describe the content they contain.
					They provide no information about the meaning or structure of the content enclosed within them.</li>

				<li>Semantic tags clearly define the content’s purpose and structure.
					They provide meaning to the content enclosed, both to the browser and to developers.</li>

				<li> Relative length units specify a length in relation to another length
					property, which makes them ideal for building responsive and accessible websites. </li>

			<h2> Description of units </h2>

			<h3> px, pt</h3>
			<p>Pixels
			<p>

			<P> Pixels, or picture elements, are the smallest visible units in digital displays and images, each
				representing a point of color.
				Collectively, pixels form the images viewed on devices such as televisions, cellphones, and computer
				monitors. While technically
				an absolute unit representing a single dot on the screen, the physical size of a pixel (px) varies
				with a device's DPI and resolution,
				allowing for adaptation. In contemporary web design, a CSS pixel (px) functions as an abstract unit
				serving as a reference for other
				absolute units, calibrated to maintain a consistent perceived size across various devices and
				viewing distances.
				The pixel unit remains prevalent for web design elements necessitating fixed and precise control.
			<p>


			<p>Points</p>

			<p>In CSS, the "point" (pt) is an absolute length unit, predominantly utilized in typography and defined as
				1/72nd of an inch.
				Its nature as an absolute unit signifies that a size specified in points remains fixed and does not
				adjust in relation to other
				elements or the viewport. Originating from traditional print media, the point unit is frequently
				employed for setting font sizes
				in printed materials. In relation to other units, 1 point is approximately equivalent to 1.33 pixels.
				Although usable in CSS,
				the point unit is generally discouraged for screen-based designs due to variations in screen
				resolutions, which can cause a
				fixed point size to render inconsistently across different devices. For web design, units such as pixels
				(px),
				em (relative to the parent's font size), or rem (relative to the root font size)
				are more commonly favored to ensure enhanced responsiveness and accessibility.</p>

			<h3> em and rem </h3>

			<p>em and rem are font-relative units frequently used to create scalable and accessible layouts. </p>

			<h3> em </h3>

			<p>`em` and `rem` are CSS units. With nested elements, the `em` unit has a compounding impact since it is
				based on the font size of its nearest parent element.
				For proportional scaling, for instance, a nested `div` with `font-size: 1.5em` will be 150% of the font
				size of its parent. The `rem` unit, which stands
				for "root em," is proportional to the font size of the root element (`html`) of the page. Because all
				`rem` units relate to the same base value,
				this guarantees uniform sizing throughout a webpage, improving predictability for responsive typography
				and simplifying scaling. With `rem`
				values for margins and padding scaling proportionately, `rem` units enable users to change text size
				using browser default settings for accessibility.</p>

			<h3>rem</h3>

			<p>The "rem" unit, or "root em," establishes a sizing reference directly tied to the font size of the root
				HTML element.
				This creates a uniform scaling baseline across a webpage, which is particularly advantageous for
				responsive typography
				and overall layout consistency. Unlike "em" units, which are relative to their parent element's font
				size, "rem" units
				consistently refer to the <html> element's font size. By default, browsers set this to 16px, making 1rem
				equivalent
				to 16px unless this base value is modified. This consistent reference point is highly effective for
				scalable and
				accessible design. Altering the <html> element's font size will proportionally scale all elements sized
				with
				"rem" units throughout the document. This capability benefits responsive design by allowing typography
				and
				spacing adjustments for different screen sizes via media queries and root font size modifications.
				Furthermore,
				it enhances accessibility by enabling users to control website scaling through their browser's default
				font size settings,
				which "rem" units respect. The "rem" unit can be applied to various CSS properties such as font-size,
				padding, margin, width,
				and height, ensuring uniform scaling relative to the root font size.</p>

			<h3>vmin; vmax </h3>

			<p>These units are relative to the size of the viewport (the browser window) and are essential for
				creating designs that adapt to different screen sizes.</p>


			<h3>vmin (Viewport Minimum) </h3>

			<p>The CSS unit 'vmin', which is 1%, represents the viewport's smaller dimension (width or
				height).
				Adaptive sizing is made easier by this unit, which ensures that elements scale proportionately
				within
				viewport constraints. For instance, the width of a viewport that is 700 pixels wide by 900
				pixels tall
				shows that 1vmin is equivalent to 7 pixels. Vmin is especially helpful for mobile-first designs
				and for
				elements like headers and footers that require consistent relative sizing to prevent excessive
				negative
				space on smaller screens.represents 1% of the viewport's smaller dimensions, which can be either
				width or
				height.It is helpful for producing a square element that, even when the viewport is resized,
				remains visible
				on the screen at all times without spilling over.</p>


			<h3>vmax (Viewport Maximum)</h3>

			<p>The context-dependent term "max (Viewport Maximum)" can refer to either the `maximum-scale`
				attribute
				in an
				HTML viewport meta tag or the CSS unit `vmax`. A relative CSS measurement, the `vmax` unit is
				1/100th of
				the browser's
				viewport's larger dimension; for instance, 10vmax in a 1000px by 1200px viewport is 120px. With
				values
				like `maximum-scale=2.0`
				permitting twofold zoom and `maximum-scale=1.0` prohibiting any zoom, the `maximum-scale` attribute,
				on
				the other hand, restricts user zoom on a webpage.
				In order to differentiate between CSS styling and mobile device interaction controls, context is
				essential.</p>
