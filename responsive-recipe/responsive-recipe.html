        <h2>How to Make German Chocolate Cake</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Make the chocolate cake:</strong> Combine dry ingredients (sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt). Combine wet ingredients (eggs, buttermilk, oil and vanilla). Mix together and stir in boiling water.</li>
          <li><strong>Bake at 375°F:</strong> Pour batter into prepared 8 or 9-inch round baking pans. Cut a round piece of wax or parchment paper for the bottom of the pan to help the cake release easily.</li>
          <li><strong>Make the German Chocolate Frosting:</strong> Combine brown sugar, granulated sugar, butter, egg yolks, and evaporated milk in a saucepan. Bring to a low boil over medium heat, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla, nuts, and coconut. Allow to cool completely before layering it on the cake.</li>
          <li><strong>Make chocolate frosting:</strong> Melt butter, stir in cocoa powder, and slowly add powdered sugar and milk until you reach a spreading consistency. Add extra milk or powdered sugar as needed. Stir in vanilla.</li>
          <li><strong>Assemble:</strong> Place one cake round on your serving stand or plate. Smooth a thin layer of chocolate frosting over the cake layer, then spoon half of the coconut frosting on top, spreading it evenly (leave about ½ inch from the edge). Stack the second cake round on top, frost the entire cake with chocolate frosting, and spoon remaining coconut frosting on top.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="pro-tips">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <p><strong>Use room temperature ingredients:</strong> Run hot water over the eggs to bring them to room temperature, and slightly warm the buttermilk in the microwave. It makes a big difference!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="make-ahead">
          <h3>Make Ahead and Freezing Instructions</h3>
          <p><strong>To Make Ahead:</strong> Both frostings (coconut and chocolate) can be made ahead and stored in covered containers in the fridge. The coconut frosting will keep for 1–2 weeks; the chocolate frosting for 2–3 weeks. Remove from fridge an hour before frosting the cake to allow them to soften.</p>
          <p><strong>To Freeze:</strong> After baking, let cake layers cool completely, then wrap in plastic wrap and place in freezer bags. Freeze up to three months. Frost the cake while still frozen — it’s easier to frost this way! You can also freeze the assembled cake for 2–3 months (wrap individual slices well for best results). Let thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>
