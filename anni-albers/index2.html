                <p>It is safe, I suppose, to assume that today most if not all of us have had the experience of looking
                    down from an airplane onto this earth.
                    What we see is a free flow of forms intersected here and there by straight lines, rectangles,
                    circles, and evenly drawn curves; that is, by shapes of great regularity. Here we have, then,
                    natural and man-made forms in contradistinction. And
                    here before us we can recognize the essence of designing a visually comprehensible, simplified
                    organization of forms that is distinct
                    from nature’s secretive and complex working. </p>

                        use our characteristics: forms that, however far they may deviate in their final
                        development, are intrinsically geometric.”</em></p>

                    not used before,
                    will have to consider the matter of “calculated obsolescence.” We are urged today to want
                    more and more things, and we are subjected to a vigorous campaigning for always newer things, things
                    that are not necessarily newer in performance. We are asked to shift from red to blue or from this
                    bit of trimming to that for the questionable reason or unreason of fashion. It is evident, I think,
                    that the designer who takes the longer view is by no means identical with the “successful”
                    designer….</p>

                <p> To turn from “looking at” to action: we grow cabbages in straight rows and are not tempted
                    by nature’s fanciful way of planting to scatter them freely about.
                    We may argue that sometimes we follow her method and plant a bush here and another there,
                    but even then we “clear” the ground Always, though sometimes in a way that is roundabout and
                    apparent only as an underlying
                    scheme of composition, it is clarity that we seek.But when the matter of usefulness is involved, we
                    plainly and without qualification use our
                    characteristics: forms that, however far they may deviate in their final development, are

            <bold>About the Author</bold>
        </h2>

    <p>Anni Albers was a pioneering textile artist who elevated weaving from
        a craft to a fine art through her innovative use of materials.
        She explored the potential of both natural and industrial fibers,
        incorporating materials like cellophane for its light-reflective
        and sound-dampening qualities, metallic threads for shine, and
        synthetic fibers like rayon. Alongside these, she utilized humble
        materials such as jute and everyday objects, challenging traditional
        notions of value. Albers's approach emphasized material properties
        and tactile experimentation, believing design should stem from the
        inherent characteristics of the medium. Her work also extended to
        architectural applications and highlighted texture and structure
        through deliberate material contrasts, distinguishing textile art
        from other visual media.</p>

    <p>Anni Albers treated threads as a painter uses paint, moving beyond
        basic loom techniques to create complex surfaces in her pictorial
        weavings,
        designed as hanging artworks. Influenced by the Bauhaus and
        pre-Columbian textiles, she employed techniques such as brocade,
        leno, floating weft,
        and double/triple weaving. Albers innovatively combined natural
        fibers with synthetic and metallic threads like cellophane and
        lurex, exploring texture
        and reflectivity. Her design approach manipulated the weaving grid,
        drawing inspiration from ancient Peruvian textiles and experimenting
        with knotting
        for linear structures. Key influences on her artistic career
        included Bauhaus artists like Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky,
        pre-Columbian textile traditions,
        her husband Josef Albers, and American avant-garde artists
        encountered at Black Mountain College, such as John Cage. She, in
        turn, influenced artists
        like Ruth Asawa and Robert Rauschenberg. </p>
