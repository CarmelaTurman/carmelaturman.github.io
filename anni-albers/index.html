                <p>It is safe, I suppose, to assume that today most if not all of us have had the experience of looking down from an airplane onto this earth. 
                What we see is a free flow of forms intersected here and there by straight lines, rectangles, circles, and evenly drawn curves; that is, by 
                shapes of great regularity. Here we have, then, natural and man-made forms in contradistinction. And here before us we can recognize the 
                essence of designing a visually comprehensible, simplified organization of forms that is distinct from nature’s secretive and complex working. </p> 
                 </p>

        <div class="callout-box1">
            <h2><p><em>“…when the matter of usefulness is involved, we plainly and without qualification 
                    use our characteristics: forms that, however far they may deviate in their final 
                    development, are intrinsically geometric.”</em></p></h2>

                <h3><p> To turn from “looking at” to action: we grow cabbages in straight rows and are not tempted by nature’s fanciful way of planting to scatter them freely about. 
                We may argue that sometimes we follow her method and plant a bush here and another there, but even then we “clear” the ground. 
                Always, though sometimes in a way that is roundabout and apparent only as an underlying scheme of composition, it is clarity that we seek. 
                But when the matter of usefulness is involved, we plainly and without qualification use our characteristics: forms that, however far they may 
                deviate in their final development, are intrinsically geometric. </p></h3>

                <h2><p><em> “Culture, surely, is measured by art, which sets the standard of quality 
                toward which broad production slowly moves or should move.” </em></p></h2>
        </div>

        <div class="Content-Box">
            <div class="Content-Box3">
                <h3><p> For we certainly realize that there are no exclusive materials reserved for art, though we are often told otherwise. Neither preciousness nor durability of material are 
                prerequisites. A work of art, we know, can be made of sand or sound, of features or flowers, as much as of marble or gold. Any material, any working procedure, and any method of
                production, manual or industrial, can serve an end that may be art. It is interesting to see how today’s artists, for example our sculptors, are exploring new media
                and are thereby fundamentally changing the sculptural process from the traditional method of cutting away to one of joining. They are giving us, instead of massive contour, 
                exposed structure; instead of opaqueness, transmission of light. Obviously, then, regardless of the material and the method of working it, designing is or should be 
                methodical planning, whether of simple or intricately organized forms; and if done imaginatively and sensitively, designing can become art….</p></h3>

            <h2><p><em>“Nevertheless, we are seldom found — on train or plane, on bus or boat, 
                    or in any given moment of imposed restraint of action 
                     — without a bundle of distractions in our hand….”</em></p></h2>

                <h3><p>For the economy of today is built largely upon change, and the “successful” designer, a term I have not used before, will have to consider the matter of 
                “calculated obsolescence.” We are urged today to want more and more things, and we are subjected to a vigorous campaigning for always newer things, 
                things that are not necessarily newer in performance. We are asked to shift from red to blue or from this bit of trimming to that for the questionable 
                reason or unreason of fashion. It is evident, I think, that the designer who takes the longer view is by no means identical with the “successful” designer….</p></h3>

                <h3><p>As you will have noticed, I have made no distinction between the craftsman designer, the industrial designer, and the artist — because the fundamental, 
                if not the specific, considerations are the same, I believe, for those who work with the conscience and apperception of the artist. With surprise and 
                reassurance I recently came across a statement by the painter Lionel Feininger, who speaks of one of his pictures as having “painted itself.”</p></h3>

<h2><bold>About the Author</bold></h2> 
</header>

    <p>Anni Albers was a pioneering textile artist who elevated weaving from a craft to a fine art through her innovative use of materials. 
    She explored the potential of both natural and industrial fibers, incorporating materials like cellophane for its light-reflective 
    and sound-dampening qualities, metallic threads for shine, and synthetic fibers like rayon. Alongside these, she utilized humble 
    materials such as jute and everyday objects, challenging traditional notions of value. Albers's approach emphasized material properties 
    and tactile experimentation, believing design should stem from the inherent characteristics of the medium. Her work also extended to 
    architectural applications and highlighted texture and structure through deliberate material contrasts, distinguishing textile art 
    from other visual media.</p>  

    <p>Anni Albers treated threads as a painter uses paint, moving beyond basic loom techniques to create complex surfaces in her pictorial weavings, 
    designed as hanging artworks. Influenced by the Bauhaus and pre-Columbian textiles, she employed techniques such as brocade, leno, floating weft,
    and double/triple weaving. Albers innovatively combined natural fibers with synthetic and metallic threads like cellophane and lurex, exploring texture 
    and reflectivity. Her design approach manipulated the weaving grid, drawing inspiration from ancient Peruvian textiles and experimenting with knotting 
    for linear structures. Key influences on her artistic career included Bauhaus artists like Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky, pre-Columbian textile traditions, 
    her husband Josef Albers, and American avant-garde artists encountered at Black Mountain College, such as John Cage. She, in turn, influenced artists 
    like Ruth Asawa and Robert Rauschenberg. </p>
