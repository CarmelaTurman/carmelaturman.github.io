<p>Round 51</p>

<p>When working into the top of the popcorn stitches you will be working into the first dc of the popcorn, through which you pulled the last dc of the popcorn. You will find this stitch immediately to the right of the popcorn (left if you are left-handed).</p>

<p>If you are using the same colour, ch 3 (counts as hdc + ch-1). Hdc in the same stitch. This is your first corner made.</p>

<p>If you are using a new colour, join your yarn by making a standing half-double crochet in the same st as the sl st join. (Ch 1, hdc) in the same stitch. This is your first corner made (Photo 1).</p>

<p>Short Side: Sc in the next ch-1 space (Photo 2). Skip the first (hidden) stitch – indicated with an arrow in Photo 2. Sc in the next 15 st’s. The last sc should fall in the sc made into the hdc from Round 49 (Photo 3). Fpdc around the hdc between the leaves from Round 49 (Photo 4). Sc in the next 15 st’s. Skip the last st and sc in the next ch-1 space (Photo 5).</p>

<p>Long Side: (Hdc, ch 1, hdc) in the next (hidden) stitch (Photo 6). Make a fptr around the fptr from Round 49 (Photo 7). Skip the next 2 st’s (Photo 8). Hdc in the next 4 st’s (Photos 9 and 10). The second hdc should fall in the top of the popcorn stitch – see the note at the start of the round and Photo 9 below.</p>

<p>(Fptr around the next fptr from Round 49 – see Photo 11. Skip the next st of Round 50 and hdc in the next 2 st’s – see Photo 12. Fptr around the next fptr from Round 49 and skip the next st of Round 50 – see Photo 13. Hdc in the next 4 st’s. The second hdc should fall in the top of the popcorn stitch – see Photo 14) 8 times.</p>

<p>Fptr around the next fptr from Round 49 and skip the next st of Round 50 (Photo 15). (Hdc, ch 1, hdc) in the next st, which will be the first sc of the previous (sc, ch-1, sc) corner (Photo 16).</p>

<p>Repeat from to 3 more times, omitting the last (hdc, ch 1, hdc) corner on the last repeat. Join to the second ch of the beginning ch-3 (or the top of the standing hdc) with a sl st.</p>

<p>Stitch Counts:<br>

Per Long Side: 71 st’s {2 hdc’s and 69 dc’s}</p>

<p>Round 53</p>

<p>When you make the fpdtr’s you will be adding a stitch to each repeat by making 2 and only skipping 1. Do not worry about this. We will decrease again in the next round. You will notice that this round has a tendency to curl right over. Do not worry about this (Photo 14 below)!</p>

<p>If you are going to use the same colour, ch 3 (counts as hdc + ch-1). Hdc in the same stitch. This is your first corner made.</p>

(Hdc, ch 1, hdc) in the next st, which will be the first hdc of the (hdc, ch 1, hdc) corner from the previous round (Photo 13).</p>

<p>Repeat from to 3 more times, omitting the last (hdc, ch 1, hdc) corner on the last repeat. Join to the second ch of the beginning ch-3 (or the top of the standing hdc) with a sl st.</p>

<p>Stitch Counts:<br>
Total: 476 st’s and 8 ch-1 corner spaces {152 sc’s, 16 hdc’s, 232 dc’s, 4 fpdc’s, and 72 fpdtr’s}<br>

<p>Stitch Counts:<br>
Total: 452 sc’s and 8 ch-1 corner spaces<br>
Per Short Side: 45 sc’s<br>
Per Long Side: 68 sc’s</p>

<p>Round 55</p>

<p>If you are using the same colour, sl st into the next ch-1 space. (Ch 1, sc, ch 1, sc) in the same ch-1 space. This is your first corner made.</p>

<p>If you are using a new colour, join your yarn by making a standing single crochet in the ch-1 space at the start of any short side. (Ch 1, sc) in the same ch-1 space. This is your first corner made (Photo 1).</p>

<p>Short Side: Sc in the next 22 st’s, remembering to work into that first (hidden) stitch (Photo 2). Make a fpdc around the fpdc from Round 53 (Photo 3) and skip the next st of Round 54. Sc in the next 22 st’s (Photo 4). The fpdc in the middle of the short side will be slightly skew. Don’t worry about it.</p>

<p>Long Side: (Sc, ch 1, sc) in the next ch-1 space (Photo 5). Make a fptr around the first fpdtr from Round 53 (Photos 6 and 7). Skip the first (hidden) stitch AND the next 2 st’s of Round 54 (Photo 8). Hdc in the next 63 st’s. The seventh hdc should fall in the next sc2tog, and the last hdc should fall in the top of the last sc2tog from the previous round (Photo 9). Make a fptr around the last fpdtr from Round 53 (indicated with an arrow in Photo 9 and illustrated in Photos 10 and 11). Skip the last 2 st’s of Round 54. (Sc, ch 1, sc) in the next ch-1 space (Photo 12).</p>

<p>Repeat from to 3 more times, omitting the last (sc, ch 1, sc) corner on the last repeat. Join to the first sc with a sl st.</p>

<p>Stitch Counts:<br>

Per Short Side: 47 st’s {46 sc’s and 1 fpdc}<br>
Per Long Side: 67 st’s {2 sc’s, 63 hdc’s and 2 fptr’s}</p>

<p>Round 56</p>

<p>If you are using the same colour, sl st into the next ch-1 space. Ch 2 (counts as hdc). Hdc in the same ch-1 space. This is your first 2-hdc corner made.</p>

<p>If you are using a new colour, join your yarn by making a standing half-double crochet in the ch-1 space at the start of any short side. Hdc in the same ch-1 space. This is your first 2-hdc corner made (Photo 1).</p>

<p>Skip the first (hidden) stitch. Sc in the next 46 st’s. The 23rd sc will fall in the fpdc from the previous round. Make 2 hdc’s in the next ch-1 space (Photo 2).</p>

<p>Long Side: Make a cluster, working into the first (hidden) sc, the fptr, and the next hdc (indicated with arrows in Photo 2 and illustrated in Photos 3 and 4). Dc in the next 62 st’s. I strongly suggest that you mark the second dc after the cluster with a st marker or a piece of scrap yarn. In fact…I insist on it. The last dc should fall in the hdc before the fptr (Photo 5). Make a cluster, working into the fptr, the next sc, and the ch-1 space (Photos 6 and 7).</p>

<p>Short Side: Make 2 hdc’s in the ch-1 space that already contains the last “leg” of the 3-dc cluster (Photo 8). Skip the first (hidden) stitch. Sc in the next 46 st’s. The 23rd sc will fall in the fpdc from the previous round. Make 2 hdc’s in the next ch-1 space.</p>

<p>Repeat from to 3 more times, omitting the last short side on the last repeat. Join to the top of the beginning ch-2 (or the standing half-double crochet) with a sl st. Fasten off and work away your tails of yarn.</p>

<p>Stitch Counts:<br>
Total: 456 st’s {184 sc’s, 16 hdc’s, 248 dc’s, and 8 clusters}<br>
Per Short Side: 50 st’s {46 sc’s and 4 hdc’s}<br>
Per Long Side: 64 st’s {62 dc’s and 2 clusters}</p>

<p>Round 57</p>

<p>If you want to use the same colour for this round (as I have done) you will still need to bind off at the end of the previous round, because this round starts in the stitch before the sl st join.</p>

<p>There are no clear-cut landmarks on the Long Side, so if didn’t mark the stitches I told you to mark in the previous round, please take a moment and do so now. Do not forget to make the ch-1 spaces at the start and end of each long side, which will count as your ch-1 corner spaces.</p>

<p>Mark these ch-1 spaces if you are going to have trouble identifying them later.</p>

<p>Join your yarn by making a standing double crochet in the cluster at the end of any long side.</p>

<p>Hdc in the next st (Photo 1). Sc in the next 24 st’s. The last sc will fall in the sc you made into the fpdc from Round 55. Make a fpdc around the fpdc from Round 55 and skip the next st of Round 56. Sc in the next 24 st’s. The last sc should fall in the second hdc of the 2-hdc corner from the previous round. Hdc in the next stitch, which will be the cluster (Photo 2). Dc in the next st (Photo 3).</p>

<p>Long Side: Ch 1 and make a fpdtr around the fptr from Round 55 (Photos 4 and 5). Dc in the next st, which should be the marked dc from the previous round. Dc in the next 4 st’s (Photo 6). Ch 3 and skip the next 3 st’s. (Dc in the next 5 st’s. Ch 3 and skip the next 3 st’s) 6 times. Each ch-3 space should fall directly above the tip of one of the petals from Rounds 49-53 (Photo 7). Dc in the last 5 dc’s before the cluster (Photo 8). Make a fpdtr around the fptr from Round 55 (Photos 9 and 10). Ch 1.</p>

<p>Short Side: Make a dc in the next st, which will be the cluster (Photo 11). Hdc in the next st (Photo 12). Sc in the next 24 st’s. The last sc will fall in the sc you made into the fpdc from Round 55. Make a fpdc around the fpdc from Round 55 and skip the next st of Round 56. Sc in the next 24 st’s. The last sc should fall in the second hdc of the 2-hdc corner from the previous round. Hdc in the next stitch, which will be the cluster. Dc in the next st.</p>

<p>Repeat from to 3 more times, omitting the last short side on the last repeat. Join to the top of the standing double crochet with a sl st.</p>

<p>Fasten off and work away your tails of yarn.</p>

<p>Stitch Counts:<br>
Total: 380 st’s, 28 ch-3 spaces, and 8 ch-1 corner spaces {192 sc’s, 8 hdc’s, 168 dc’s, 4 fpdc’s, and 8 fpdtr’s}<br>
Per Short Side: 53 st’s {48 sc’s, 2 hdc’s, 2 dc’s, and 1 fpdc}<br>
Per Long Side: 42 st’s and 7 ch-3 spaces {40 dc’s and 2 fpdtr’s}</p>

<p>Round 58 {Leaves}</p>

<p>We will be making some more leaves in this round. If you need a reminder of how to make the Beginning Tr Bobbles on the short side, see the Special Stitches at the start of Part 6. On the long sides, you will be making regular Tr Bobbles – see Special Stitches above.</p>

<p>Round 58 {Leaves}</p>

<p>We will be making some more leaves in this round. If you need a reminder of how to make the Beginning Tr Bobbles on the short side, see the Special Stitches at the start of Part 6. On the long sides, you will be making regular Tr Bobbles – see Special Stitches above.</p>

<p>Right. Let’s get started with my favourite round of the whole pattern. I hope you are excited!</p>

<p>If you are using the same colour, (ch 1, sc, ch 1, sc) in the same stitch as the sl st join. This is your first corner made.</p>

<p>If you are using a new colour, join your yarn by making a standing single crochet in the same stitch as the sl st join, which should be the first sc of the (sc, ch 1, sc) corner from the previous round. (Ch 1, sc) in the same stitch. This is your first corner made.</p>

<p>Short Side: Sc in the ch-1 corner space (Photo 1). Skip the next (hidden) st of Round 58. (Sc in the flo of the next st from Round 57, which already contains the blo sc from Round 58 – Photo 2. Working in front of the next ch-6 space, sc in the next 6 st’s of Round 57 – Photo 3) 3 times.</p>

<p>Sc in the flo of the next st from Round 57, which should be the last st before the leaf (Photo 4). Working behind the leaves, skip the next 2 available st’s from Round 57. Make 4 tr’s in the next st, which will be the sc before the fpdc (Photo 5). Make 4 tr’s in the next st, which should be the fpdc (Photo 6). Skip the next 3 st’s of Round 57 (behind the second leaf).</p>

<p>Sc in the flo of the next available st from Round 57, which already contains the blo sc from Round 58 (Photos 7 and 8). (Working in front of the next ch-6 space, sc in the next 6 st’s of Round 57. Sc in the flo of the next st from Round 57) 3 times (Photo 9). Skip the next st of Round 58 and sc in the ch-1 space (Photo 10).</p>

<p>Long Side: Skip the first (hidden) stitch. (Sc, ch 1, sc) in the next st (indicated with an arrow in Photo 10 and illustrated in Photo 11). Ch 3 and skip the next 3 st’s, which will be the 2 sc’s and the first leaf (Photo 12). Make a rose in the next ch-3/ch-5 space (see Rose at the start of this round) – Photos 13 and 14.</p>

<p>(Ch 4 – Photo 15, and make a rose into the next ch-3/ch-5 space) 6 times. Ch 3 and skip the next 4 st’s, which will be the last leaf and the next 3 sc’s. (Sc, ch 1, sc) in the next st, which will be the first sc of the (sc, ch 1, sc) corner from the previous round (Photo 16).</p>

<p>Repeat from to 3 more times, omitting the last (sc, ch 1, sc) corner on the last repeat. Join to the top of the first sc with a sl st.</p>

<p>Fasten off and work away your tails of yarn.</p>

<p>Stitch Counts:<br>
Total: 260 st’s, 8 ch-3 spaces, 24 ch-4 spaces, and 8 ch-1 corner spaces {200 sc’s, 32 tr’s, and 28 roses}<br>
Per Short Side: 56 st’s {48 sc’s, of which 8 are flo, and 8 tr’s}<br>
Per Long Side: 9 st’s, 2 ch-3 spaces, and 6 ch-4 spaces {2 sc’s and 7 roses}</p>

<p>Round 60</p>

<p>Do not forget to make the ch-1 spaces at the start and end of each long side, which will count as your ch-1 corner spaces. Mark these ch-1 spaces if you are going to have trouble identifying them later.</p>

<p>When making the long sides, you can work in front of the ch spaces from Round 59, or over them. It is up to you. I will say that your roses will be slightly neater if you work in front of the ch spaces from Round 59.</p>

<p>If you are using the same colour, sl st into the next ch-1 space. (Ch 1, sc) in the same ch-1 space.</p>

<p>If you are using a new colour, join your yarn by making a standing single crochet in the ch-1 space at the start of any short side (Photo 1).</p>

<p>Short Side: Make a bpsc in each of the next 24 sc’s, including the first (hidden) sc (Photos 2 and 3). Ch 3 (Photo 4). Make a bpsc in the sc from Round 57 that contains the first 4 tr’s of the 8-tr “flower” from Round 59 (Photo 5). Ch 3 (Photo 6). Photo 7 shows the little line formed by the bpsc. Skip the 8 tr’s from Round 59 and make a bpsc in each of the next 24 sc’s (Photo 8).</p>

<p>Long Side: Sc in the next ch-1 space (Photo 9). Ch 1 and make a fptr around the fpdtr from Round 57 (Photos 10 and 11). Skip the first (hidden) stitch of Round 59 and the next available stitch of Round 58, which you will find below the first ch-3 space from Round 59. Photo 12 shows the skipped stitch indicated with an arrow. The ch-3 from Round 59 is not visible, because it is behind my work.</p>

<p>{Sc, hdc, dc} in the next sc from Round 58 (Photo 12). {Dc, hdc, sc} between the same sc and the next Tr Bobble leaf. To work between these 2 st’s, insert your hook under all the loops of the Tr Bobble (indicated with an arrow in Photo 13 and ...</p>
