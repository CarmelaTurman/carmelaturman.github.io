Per Side: 74 st’s {24 bpsc’s, 36 sc’s, 2 bphdc’s, and 12 tr’s} 

 

Round 33 

In this round you will be making little zigzag “hills” using surface crochet. This round is very slightly asymmetrical. There are 20 sc’s before the zigzags, and only 19 sc’s after them (including the last st of the last “hill”, but not including the corner sc’s).

*Skip the first hdc, which will be hidden anyway {Photo 1} and hdc in the next 18 st’s {Photos 2 and 3}. Bpdc around the fourth bpsc of the “petal” formed by Rounds 30 and 31 {Photos 4 and 5}. Skip the next st of Round 34 {indicated with an arrow in Photo 6} and hdc in the next 40 st’s. Bpdc around the fourth bpsc of the “petal” formed by Rounds 30 and 31.

Round 36 

 

If you are using the same colour, sl st into the next hdc and into the ch-2 space. (Ch 1, sc, ch 2, sc) in the same ch-2 space. 

 

If you are using a new colour, join your yarn by making a standing single crochet in any ch-2 corner around. (Ch 2, sc) in the same corner space.

Bind off and work away your tails of yarn.  If you need visual help, see the photo for the Optional Flowers below.

Optional Flowers 

These flowers will be made into the bpsc’s of the 8-dc “petals” formed by Rounds 30 and 31. If you think this makes the corners look too busy, feel free to leave them out. You can make all the flowers in the same colour, or each one in a different colour. It is totally up to you. 

 

 

And if you feel like making totally different flowers, that’s also fine! 

Join your yarn to the first bpsc (Round 31) of any 8-dc “petal” from Round 30 with a sl st. (Make 4 hdc’s in the next st, sl st in the next st) 4 times. The last sl st should fall in the top of the fpdc after the petal. Bind off and work away your tails of yarn. 

Repeat for each of the 8 “petals” from Rounds 30 and 31. 

 

Special Stitches 

Popcorn Stitch: Make 5 dc’s in the same stitch.  Remove your hook from the last stitch.  Insert your hook into the first dc of the 5 dc’s.  Grab the last stitch with your hook and pull it through the first stitch.  Ch 1.  See this tutorial. 

Beginning Popcorn Stitch: Ch 3 (counts as first dc).  Make 4 dc’s in the same stitch.  Remove your hook from the last stitch.  Insert your hook into the third ch of the beginning ch-3.  Grab the last stitch with your hook and pull it through the first stitch.  Ch 1.  See this tutorial. 

V-Stitch:  (Dc, ch 1, dc) in the same stitch. 

Picot:  Ch 3, sl st in the third chain from the hook. 

 

Round 37 

 

Join your new yarn by making a standing double crochet in any ch-2 corner space around.  (Dc, hdc, 2 dc) in the same ch-2 corner space.  This is your first corner made. 

*Skip the first 2 st’s, remembering that first hidden stitch, and dc in the next 80 st’s.  Skip the last 2 st’s.  (2 dc, hdc, 2 dc) in the next ch-2 corner space.* 

Repeat from * to * 3 more times, omitting the last corner on the last repeat.  Join to the top of the standing double crochet with a sl st.  Fasten off and work away your tails of yarn. 

The first photo below shows the 2 skipped stitches on either side of the (2 dc, hdc, 2 dc) corner. 

 

Stitch Counts:  

Total: 340 st’s  {4 hdc’s and 336 dc’s} 

Per Side: 84 dc’s (not including corner hdc) 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE 

 

From this point onward, your “square” will have 8 facets (or sides).  There will be 4 short sides and 4 long sides.  As the rounds grow, the short sides will get longer and the long sides will get shorter.  You’ll soon see what I mean. 

Round 38  {Leaves} 

Join your yarn by making a standing double crochet in the fifth dc of any side.  (Ch 1, dc) in the same stitch.  This  is your first V-stitch made – see Photo 1.  (Skip the next 2 st’s and make a V-stitch in the next st – see Photo 2) 25 times.   You should now have 26 V-stitches.  There should be 4 dc’s left unworked before the corner hdc (Photo 3). 

*Short Side:  Ch 8 (Photo 4) and skip the next 9 st’s. 

Long Side:  Make a V-stitch in the fifth dc of the next side (indicated with an arrow in Photo 4 and illustrated in Photo 5).  (Skip the next 2 st’s and make a V-stitch in the next st) 25 times.* 

Repeat from * to * 3 times, omitting the last long side on the last repeat.  Join to the top of the standing double crochet with a sl st. 

 

Stitch Counts:  

Total: 104 V-st’s and 4 ch-8 spaces 

Per Short Side: 1 ch-8 space 

Per Long Side: 26 V-stitches 

 

Round 39 {Tulips} 

 

In this round, you will be forming the tulips.  Your work will seem quite tight at the end of this round, but don’t worry about it too much.  Keep your tension relaxed when making the ch-2 spaces and you will be just fine! 

 

Before we get started, let’s talk about those popcorn stitches.  Just like in Round 18 the popcorn stitches are closed with a ch st.  This ch stitch is part of the popcorn stitch!  When you are instructed to ch 2 after each popcorn stitch that ch-2 does not include the ch used to close the popcorn stitch (red arrow in Photo 2 below).   

 

If you are using the same colour, sl st into the next ch-1 space and make a beginning popcorn (see Special Stitches above). 

 

If you are using a new colour, join your yarn by making a standing double crochet in the ch-1 space of the first V-stitch on any side. Make 4 more dc’s in the same ch-1 space and complete a Popcorn Stitch (Photo 1). 

(Ch 2 – see Photo 2, and make a Popcorn Stitch in the ch-1 space of the next V-stitch – see Photo 3) 25 times.  You should now have 26 popcorns, one in each V-stitch from the previous round. 

 

*Short Side:  Ch 5 (Photo 4).  Working in front of the ch-8 space from Round 38, make a fpsc around the corner hdc from Round 37.  Ch 5 (Photo 5). 

Long Side:  Make a Popcorn Stitch in the ch-1 space of the first V-stitch on the next side (Photo 6).  (Ch 2, make a Popcorn Stitch in the ch-1 space of the next V-stitch) 25 times.* 

Repeat from * to * 3 more times, omitting the last long side on the last repeat.  Join to the top of the first popcorn with a sl st. 

 

Stitch Counts:  

Total: 108 st’s, 8 ch-5 spaces, and 100 ch-2 spaces  {4 fpsc’s and 104 popcorns} 

Per Short Side: 1 fpsc and 2 ch-5 spaces 

Per Long Side: 26 popcorns and 25 ch-2 spaces 

 

Round 40 

 

In this round, you will be working into the ch-2 spaces from Round 39 AND between the V-stitches from Round 38.  When working between the V-stitches, work IN FRONT OF the relevant ch-2 space.  I have found that it is easier if you fold the ch-2 down behind your work when making the stitches between the V-stitches from Round 38, otherwise it is just in the way. 

 

If you are using the same colour, sl st into the next ch-2 space. (Ch 1, sc) into the same space.   

Working in front of the ch-2 space, dc between the 2 V-stitches from Round 38 directly below the same ch-2 space.  Sc in the same ch-2 space. 

 

If you are using a new colour, join your yarn by making a standing single crochet in the first ch-2 space of any long side (Photo 1). Working in front of the ch-2 space, dc between the 2 V-stitches from Round 38 directly below the same ch-2 space (Photos 2 -4).  Sc in the same ch-2 space (Photo 5). 

(Skip the next popcorn.  Sc in the next ch-2 space.  Working in front of the ch-2, dc between the 2 V-stitches from Round 38 directly below the same ch-2 space.  Sc in the same ch-2 space) 24 times. 

 

*Short Side:  Make 4 sc’s into the first ch-5 space (Photo 6).  Working in front of the ch-5 space, dc in the first corner dc from Round 37 and hdc in the next corner dc.  Sc in the top of the fpsc from Round 39 (Photo 7).  Sc in the next ch-5 space (Photo 8).  Working in front of the ch-5 space, hdc in the next corner dc from Round 37 and dc in the last corner dc.  Make 4 sc’s into the same (last) ch-5 space (Photo 9). 

 

Long Side:  (Skip the next popcorn.  Sc in the next ch-2 space.  Working in front of the ch-2, dc between the 2 V-stitches from Round 38 directly below the same ch-2 space.  Sc in the same ch-2 space) 25 times.* 

Repeat from * to * 3 more times, omitting the last long side on the last repeat.  Join to the top of the first sc with a sl st.  Fasten off and work away your tails of yarn. 

Stitch Counts:  

Total: 356 st’s  {240 sc’s, 8 hdc’s, and 108 dc’s} 

Per Short Side: 14 st’s  {10 sc’s, 2 hdc’s, and 2 dc’s} 

Per Long Side: 75 st’s  {50 sc’s and 25 dc’s}
