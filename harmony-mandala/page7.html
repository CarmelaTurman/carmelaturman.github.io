Round 41 {Purple Petals} 

 

You will be making pretty Purple Petals in this round.  The petals are similar to the ones used in Rounds 10 and 13. 

 

UPDATE:  Please read this round carefully.  Not all the petals will fall in a dc between popcorns.  ONLY Petals 1, 4, 7, and 10, as specified in the Hint below this round.  If you struggle with this round, please have a look at the brilliant video tutorial that Esther Dijkstra has done. 

 

Join your yarn by making a standing single crochet in the fourth sc made into the first ch-5 space of any short side.  Sc in the next 3 st’s (Photo 1).  The last sc should fall in the sc you made into the fpsc from Round 39.  Fpdc around the fpsc from Round 39 (Photo 2).  Sc in the next st of Round 40, directly behind the fpdc you just made.  Sc in the next 3 st’s (Photo 3).  The last sc should fall in the first sc after the dc.  This is your first short side made. 

 

*Long Side:  Sc in the next st.  Mark this stitch with a stitch marker to make it easier to count your stitches later on (Photo 4). (Skip the next 3 st’s.  Make 4 tr’s in the next st – see Photo 5.  Ch 3 and sl st into the third ch from your hook.  This is your picot made.  Make 4 tr’s in the same st.  Skip the next 3 st’s and sc in the next st – see Photo 6) 10 times – see Hint below.  The last sc should fall in the third sc made into the first ch-5 space of the short side (Photo 7).  Mark this stitch with a stitch marker to help with counting later.  You should now have 10 petals, each separated by one single crochet.   

 

Short Side:  Sc in the next 4 st’s.  Fpdc around the fpsc from Round 39.  Sc in the next st of Round 40, directly behind the fpdc you just made.  Sc in the next 3 st’s.* 

Repeat from * to * 3 more times, omitting the last short side on the last repeat.  Join to the first sc with a sl st. 

 

Fasten off and work away your tails of yarn.  Once you have counted your stitches (see Stitch Counts below), you can remove the stitch markers again. 

 

Hint 

 

To help prevent copious amounts of frogging, I am going to give you a little tip.  The first petal will fall in the dc between the first 2 popcorns.  The fourth petal will fall in the dc between the ninth and tenth popcorns.  The seventh petal will fall in the dc between the seventeenth and eighteenth popcorns.  The tenth petal will fall in the dc between the last 2 popcorns. 

 

You don’t necessarily have to count the popcorns, but you SHOULD check that petals 1, 4, 7, and 10 fall in a dc.  If they don’t, you’ve made a booboo.  Have a look at Photo 9 if you need visual help with this. 

 

Stitch Counts:  

Total: 400 st’s and 40 picots  {76 sc’s, 4 fpdc’s, 320 tr’s, and 40 picots} 

Per Short Side: 9 st’s  {8 sc’s and 1 fpdc} 

Per Long Side (starting at the first marked stitch and ending at the last marked stitch):   10 petals and 11 sc’s  {8 tr’s and 1 picot per petal} 

 

Round 42 

 

Keep your tension relaxed when making the ch-3 spaces.  When working into the back loops only, your stitches might look very “stretchy”.  Don’t worry about it! It will all magically work out.   

If you are going to have trouble identifying the ch-1 spaces at the start and end of every short side, consider using stitch markers to mark them. 

 

Join your new yarn by making a standing single crochet in the seventh treble of the last petal on any long side.  (Ch 1, sc) in the same stitch.  Sc in the last tr of the petal and hdc in the next st (Photo 1).  Sc in the next 9 st’s.  The fifth sc will fall in the top of the fpdc from the previous round.  Hdc in the next st.  Sc in the first tr of the first petal.  (Sc, ch 1, sc) in the next tr.  This is your first short side made (Photo 2). 

 

Round 43 

 

The ch-1 spaces are a bit tricky to get into.  It is also quite easy to accidentally skip the first sc after the ch-1 space.  You will have to skip some of these “hidden” sc’s on purpose, so make sure that you can identify them.  See this tutorial if you need a recap of which loops belong to which stitch. 

 

If you are using the same colour, (ch 1, sc, ch 1, sc) in the same stitch as the sl st join.  This is your first corner made. 

If you are using a new colour, join your yarn by making a standing single crochet in the last sc of any long side (in other words, the sc before the ch-1 space). (Ch 1, sc) in the same stitch (Photo 1).  This is your first corner made. 

 

Sc in the next ch-1 space (Photo 2).  Skip the next (hidden) st and sc in the next 7 st’s (indicated with an arrow in Photo 2 and illustrated in Photo 3).  The last sc should fall in the sc made into the fpdc from Round 41.  Make a fpdc around the fpdc from Round 41 (Photo 4).  Sc in the next 7 st’s of Round 42.  Sc in the next ch-1 space (Photo 5).  (Sc, ch 1, sc) in the next (hidden) st (indicated with an arrow in Photo 5 and illustrated in Photo 6).  This is your first short side made. 

 

*Long Side: Make 2 sc’s in the next ch-3 space (Photo 7).  Sc in the next 5 st’s (Photo 8).  (Make 3 sc’s in the next ch-3 space.  Sc in the next 5 st’s) 8 times.  Make 2 sc’s in the last ch-3 space. 

 

Short Side:  (sc, ch 1, sc) in the next st.  Sc in the next ch-1 space.  Skip the next (hidden) st and sc in the next 7 st’s.  Make a fpdc around the fpdc from Round 41.  Sc in the next 7 st’s.  Sc in the next ch-1 space.  (Sc, ch 1, sc) in the next (hidden) stitch.* 

Repeat from * to * 3 more times, omitting the last short side on the last repeat.  Join to the first sc with a sl st. 

 

Stitch Counts:  

Total: 376 st’s and 8 ch-1 corner spaces  {372 sc’s and 4 fpdc’s} 

Per Short Side: 19 st’s  {18 sc’s and 1 fpdc} 

Per Long Side: 75 sc’s 

 

Round 44 

 

Each long side starts with 4 sc’s and ends with 3 sc’s.  This slight asymmetry will be corrected in the next round, so do not worry about it.  

 

If you are using the same colour, (ch 1, sc, ch 1, sc) in the same stitch as the sl st join.  This is your first corner made. 

 

If you are using a new colour, join your yarn by making a standing single crochet in the same stitch as the sl st join. (Ch 1, sc) in the same stitch.  This is your first corner made. 

Sc in the next ch-1 space.  Sc in the next 19 st’s (Photo 1).  Don’t accidentally skip the first (hidden) stitch.  Sc in the next ch-1 space.  (Sc, ch 1, sc) in the next (hidden) stitch (Photo 2).  This is your first short side made. 

 

*Long Side:  Skip the next sc (indicated with an arrow in Photo 2).  Sc in the next 4 st’s.  The last sc should fall in the sc you made into the fpdc from Round 42 – see Photo 3.  (Fpdc around the fpdc from Round 42 – see Photo 4.  Skip the next st of Round 43 – see Photo 5 – and sc in the next 7 st’s.  The last sc should fall in the sc you made into the fpdc from Round 42 – see Photo 6) 8 times.  Fpdc around the fpdc from Round 42.  Skip the next st of Round 43 and sc in the next 3 st’s. 

 

Short side:  (sc, ch 1, sc) in the next st.  Sc in the next ch-1 space.  Sc in the next 19 st’s.  Don’t accidentally skip the first (hidden) stitch.  Sc in the next ch-1 space.  (Sc, ch 1, sc) in the next (hidden) stitch.* 

Repeat from * to * 3 more times, omitting the last short side on the last repeat.  Join to the top of the first sc with a sl st. 

 

Stitch Counts:  

Total: 380 st’s and 8 ch-1 corner spaces  {344 sc’s and 36 fpdc’s} 

Per Short Side: 23 sc’s 

Per Long Side: 74 st’s  {65 sc’s and 9 fpdc’s} 

 

Round 45 

 

If you are using the same colour, sl st into the ch-1 space. Ch 1 and make 2 sc’s in the same ch-1 space. 

 

If you are using a new colour, join your yarn by making a standing single crochet in the ch-1 space at the start of any short side. Sc in the same stitch (Photo 1). 

Skip the first (hidden) stitch.  Sc in the next 11 st’s.  The last sc should fall in the sc made into the fpdc from Round 43 (Photo 2).  Fpdc around the fpdc from Round 43 (Photo 3).  Sc in the next 11 st’s (Photo 4).  Make 2 sc’s in the next ch-1 space (Photo 5). 

 

*Long Side:  Skip the first (hidden) sc (indicated with an arrow in Photo 5).  Catch the picot from Round 41 with the next hdc.  To do this, yarn over, insert your hook into the second ch of the picot AND into the next st from Round 44, and complete an hdc through both layers – see Photos 6 and 7.  (Hdc in the next 7 st’s.  The fourth hdc should fall in the fpdc from the previous round – see Photo 8.  Catch the picot with an hdc, as before – see Photo 9) 9 times.  Photo 10 shows the last hdc of the long side made. 

 

Short Side:  Make 2 sc’s in the next ch-1 space.  Skip the first (hidden) stitch.  Sc in the next 11st’s.  The last sc should fall in the sc made into the fpdc from Round 43.    Fpdc around the fpdc from Round 43.  Sc in the next 11 st’s.  Make 2 sc’s in the next ch-1 space.* 

Repeat from * to * 3 more times, omitting the last short side on the last repeat.  Join to the top of the first sc with a sl st. 

 

Stitch Counts:  

Total: 400 st’s  {104 sc’s, 292 hdc’s, and 4 fpdc’s} 

Per Short Side: 27 st’s  {26 sc’s and 1 fpdc} – this stitch count includes both sc’s of the 2-sc corner 

Per Long Side: 73 hdc’s 

 

Special Stitches 

Popcorn stitch: Make 5 dc’s in the same stitch.  Remove your hook from the last stitch.  Insert your hook into the first dc of the 5 dc’s.  Grab the last stitch with your hook and pull it through the first stitch.  Ch 1.  See this tutorial. 

Standing Stitches: Standing sc’s, hdc’s, and dc’s are stitches used to start the round without the need for the traditional beginning chain.  Links to tutorials are supplied in each relevant round. 

 

Beginning Tr Bobble: Ch 4 (Photo 1).  Yarn over twice (Photo 2) and insert your hook into the stitch at the base of the ch-4.  Yarn over and pull up a loop.  (Yarn over and pull through 2 loops) twice – 2 loops on your hook (Photo 3).  Yarn over twice (Photo 4) and insert your hook into the same stitch.  Yarn over and pull up a loop – 5 loops on your hook.  (Yarn over and pull through 2 loops) twice – 3 loops on your hook (Photo 5).  Yarn over and pull through all 3 loops (Photo 6). 

 

Corners and Counting 

When counting the stitches for each side, you will be counting from ch-1 corner space to ch-1 corner space.  In other words, wherever the corners are formed by making a stitch on either side of a ch-1 space, the stitch on one side of the ch-1 space will belong to one side and the stitch on the other side of the ch-1 space will belong to the other side.  Just like when you are making squares.  Any exceptions will be highlighted. 

Mark the corner spaces with stitch markers if you think you might have trouble identifying them. 

 

Round 46 

 

If you are using the same colour, (ch 1, sc, ch 1, sc) in the same stitch. This is your first corner made. 

 

If you are using a new colour, join your yarn by making a standing single crochet in the same stitch as the sl st join, which should be the first sc of the 2-sc corner at the start of any short side. (Ch 1, sc) in the same stitch.  This is your first corner made (Photos 1 and 2). 

Sc in the next 26 st’s.  The last sc should fall in the second sc of the 2-sc corner – see Photo 3.  (Sc, ch 1, sc) in the next stitch (Photo 4). 

 

*Long Side:  Skip the next hdc.  Hdc in the next 3 st’s.  The last hdc should fall in the hdc made into the fpdc from Round 44 – see Photo 5.  (Fptr around the fpdc from Round 44 – see Photo 6, skip the next st of Round 45 and hdc in the next 7 st’s.  The last hdc should fall in the hdc you made into the fpdc from Round 44- see Photo 7) 8 times.  Fptr around the fpdc from Round 44.  Skip the next st of Round 45 and hdc in the next 3 st’s.  The last hdc should fall in the hdc you made into the picot (Photo 8). 

 

Short Side:  (Sc, ch 1, sc) in the next stitch (Photo 9).  Sc in the next 26 st’s.  The last sc should fall in the second sc of the 2-sc corner.  (Sc, ch 1, sc) in the next stitch.* 

Repeat from * to * 3 more times, omitting the last short side on the last repeat.  Join to the first sc with a sl st. 

 

Stitch Counts:  

Total: 404 st’s and 8 ch-1 corner spaces  {120 sc’s, 248 hdc’s, and 36 fptr’s} 

Per Short Side: 28 sc’s 

Per Long Side: 73 st’s  {2 sc’s, 62 hdc’s, and 9 fptr’s} 

 

Round 47 

 

The front-post trebles will be slightly skew in this round – see the photo of Round 47 completed below.  This will correct itself in the next couple of rounds. Do not forget to make the ch-1 spaces at the start and end of each long side, which will count as your ch-1 corner spaces.  Mark these ch-1 spaces if you are going to have trouble identifying them later. 

 

If you are using the same colour, sl st into the ch-1 space. (Ch 1, sc) in the same ch-1 space. 

 

If you are using a new colour, join your yarn by making a standing single crochet in the ch-1 space at the start of any short side (Photo 1). 

Sc in the next 14 st’s.  Don’t accidentally skip the first (hidden) stitch.  The last sc should fall in the sc made into the fpdc from Round 45 (Photo 2).  Fpdc around the fpdc from Round 45 (Photo 3).  Sc in the next 14 st’s (Photo 4).  Sc in the next ch-1 space.

The fourth hdc should fall in the fptr from Round 46 – see Photo 8) 9 times.  Fptr around the picot from Round 41.  Ch 1 and skip the next st of Round 46. 

 

Short Side:  Sc in the next ch-1 space (Photo 9).  Sc in the next 14 st’s.  Don’t accidentally skip the first (hidden) stitch.  Fpdc around the fpdc from Round 45.  Sc in the next 14 st’s.  Sc in the next ch-1 space.* 

Repeat from * to * 3 more times, omitting the last short side on the last repeat.  Join to the top of the first sc with a sl st.  Fasten off and work away your tails of yarn. 

Don’t worry if your short sides curl up a bit at the end of this round. 

 

Stitch Counts:  

Total: 416 st’s and 8 ch-1 corner spaces  {120 sc’s, 252 hdc’s, 4 fpdc’s, and 40 fptr’s} 

Per Short Side: 31 st’s  {30 sc’s and 1 fpdc} 

Per Long Side: 73 st’s  {63 hdc’s and 10 fptr’s} 

 

Round 48  {Leaves} 

 

You will be making leaves in this round, but only on the short sides. 

Join your yarn by making a standing single crochet in the ch-1 space at the start of any short side.  (Ch 1, sc) in the same ch-1 space.  This is your first corner made (Photo 1). 

 

*Short Side:  Skip the first (hidden) stitch and sc in the blo of the next st (Photo 2).  (Ch 4, skip the next 4 st’s and sc in the blo of the next st) twice (Photo 3).  Sl st in the next st (Photo 4).  There should now be 2 sc’s left unworked before the fpdc. 

Now you are going to make your first leaf by making a Beginning Tr Bobble in the same st as the sl st (Photo 5).  See Special Stitches above if you need some help.  Anchor the leaf to the “stem” in the middle of the short side by making a sc around the fpdc from Round 45 (in other words, the second fpdc down) – see Photos 6 and 7. 

To make the second leaf, make a Beginning Tr Bobble in the sc that you made around the base of the “stem” (Photo 8).  Skip the next 6 st’s of Round 47 (in other words, the 2 sc’s before the fpdc, the fpdc, and the 3 sc’s after the fpdc).  Sl st in the next st (indicated with an arrow in Photo 9 and illustrated in Photo 10). 

(Sc in the blo of the next st.  Ch 4 and skip the next 4 st’s) twice (Photo 11).  Sc in the blo of the next st (Photo 12).

If you are using the same colour, sl st into the ch-1 space. (Ch 1, sc, ch 1, sc) into the same ch-1 space.  This is your first corner made. 

 

If you are using a new colour, join your yarn by making a standing single crochet in the ch-1 space at the start of any short side. (Ch 1, sc) in the same ch-1 space.  This is your first corner made (Photo 1). 

*Short Side:  Skip the first (hidden) stitch.  Sc in the flo of the next st from Round 47 (that already contains a sc in the blo) – indicated with an arrow in Photo 1 and illustrated in Photos 2 and 3.

Working behind the first leaf, sc in the first 3 skipped stitches from Round 47 (Photo 9).  The last sc should fall in the top of the fpdc from Round 47 (Photo 10).  Make an hdc into the sc between the two leaves.  This is the sc that contains the Beginning Tr Bobble of the second leaf (indicated with an arrow in Photo 11 and illustrated in Photo 12).  Sc in the next 3 st’s from Round 47, behind the second leaf (Photo 13). 

Skip the next sl st.  (Sc in the flo of the next st from Round 47 – see Photo 14.  Working in front of the ch-4 space, sc in the 4 skipped st’s from Round 47) twice.  Sc in the flo of the next st from Round 47 (Photo 15).  Skip the next st of Round 48.

Special Stitches 

Popcorn stitch: Make 5 dc’s in the same stitch.  Remove your hook from the last stitch.  Insert your hook into the first dc of the 5 dc’s.  Grab the last stitch with your hook and pull it through the first stitch.  Ch 1.  See this tutorial. 

Standing Stitches: Standing sc’s, hdc’s, and dc’s are stitches used to start the round without the need for the traditional beginning chain.  Links to tutorials are supplied in each relevant round. 

Beginning Tr Bobble: Ch 4 (Photo 1).  Yarn over twice (Photo 2) and insert your hook into the stitch at the base of the ch-4.  Yarn over and pull up a loop.  (Yarn over and pull through 2 loops) twice – 2 loops on your hook (Photo 3).  Yarn over twice (Photo 4) and insert your hook into the same stitch.  Yarn over and pull up a loop – 5 loops on your hook.  (Yarn over and pull through 2 loops) twice – 3 loops on your hook (Photo 5).  Yarn over and pull through all 3 loops (Photo 6). 

 

Corners and Counting 

When counting the stitches for each side, you will be counting from ch-1 corner space to ch-1 corner space.  In other words, wherever the corners are formed by making a stitch on either side of a ch-1 space, the stitch on one side of the ch-1 space will belong to one side and the stitch on the other side of the ch-1 space will belong to the other side.  Just like when you are making squares.  Any exceptions will be highlighted. 

Mark the corner spaces with stitch markers if you think you might have trouble identifying them. 

 

Round 46 

 

If you are using the same colour, (ch 1, sc, ch 1, sc) in the same stitch. This is your first corner made. 

 

If you are using a new colour, join your yarn by making a standing single crochet in the same stitch as the sl st join, which should be the first sc of the 2-sc corner at the start of any short side. (Ch 1, sc) in the same stitch.  This is your first corner made (Photos 1 and 2). 

Sc in the next 26 st’s.  The last sc should fall in the second sc of the 2-sc corner – see Photo 3.  (Sc, ch 1, sc) in the next stitch (Photo 4). 

 

*Long Side:  Skip the next hdc.  Hdc in the next 3 st’s.  The last hdc should fall in the hdc made into the fpdc from Round 44 – see Photo 5.  (Fptr around the fpdc from Round 44 – see Photo 6, skip the next st of Round 45 and hdc in the next 7 st’s.  The last hdc should fall in the hdc you made into the fpdc from Round 44- see Photo 7) 8 times.  Fptr around the fpdc from Round 44.  Skip the next st of Round 45 and hdc in the next 3 st’s.  The last hdc should fall in the hdc you made into the picot (Photo 8). 

 

Short Side:  (Sc, ch 1, sc) in the next stitch (Photo 9).  Sc in the next 26 st’s.  The last sc should fall in the second sc of the 2-sc corner.  (Sc, ch 1, sc) in the next stitch.* 

Repeat from * to * 3 more times, omitting the last short side on the last repeat.  Join to the first sc with a sl st. 

 

Stitch Counts:  

Total: 404 st’s and 8 ch-1 corner spaces  {120 sc’s, 248 hdc’s, and 36 fptr’s} 

Per Short Side: 28 sc’s 

Per Long Side: 73 st’s  {2 sc’s, 62 hdc’s, and 9 fptr’s} 

  

Round 47 

 

The front-post trebles will be slightly skew in this round – see the photo of Round 47 completed below.  This will correct itself in the next couple of rounds. Do not forget to make the ch-1 spaces at the start and end of each long side, which will count as your ch-1 corner spaces.  Mark these ch-1 spaces if you are going to have trouble identifying them later. 

 

If you are using the same colour, sl st into the ch-1 space. (Ch 1, sc) in the same ch-1 space.

Round 48  {Leaves} 

 

You will be making leaves in this round, but only on the short sides. 

Join your yarn by making a standing single crochet in the ch-1 space at the start of any short side.  (Ch 1, sc) in the same ch-1 space.  This is your first corner made (Photo 1).

Now you are going to make your first leaf by making a Beginning Tr Bobble in the same st as the sl st (Photo 5).  See Special Stitches above if you need some help.  Anchor the leaf to the “stem” in the middle of the short side by making a sc around the fpdc from Round 45 (in other words, the second fpdc down) – see Photos 6 and 7. 

To make the second leaf, make a Beginning Tr Bobble in the sc that you made around the base of the “stem” (Photo 8).  Skip the next 6 st’s of Round 47 (in other words, the 2 sc’s before the fpdc, the fpdc, and the 3 sc’s after the fpdc).  Sl st in the next st (indicated with an arrow in Photo 9 and illustrated in Photo 10). 

(Sc in the blo of the next st.  Ch 4 and skip the next 4 st’s) twice (Photo 11).  Sc in the blo of the next st (Photo 12). 

 

Long Side:  (Sc, ch 1, sc) in the next ch-1 space (Photo 13).  Skip the fptr.  Sc in the next 4 st’s.  (Fptr around the fptr from Round 46 – see Photo 14.
