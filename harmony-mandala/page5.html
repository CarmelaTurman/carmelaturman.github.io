    <h3>Round 25 (Optional)</h3>

<p>
This round is optional. The crab stitch tends to make a lot of people “crabby”, but I quite like making it. Don’t worry if your mandala starts wobbling slightly when you make the crab stitch round. Once you’ve blocked it, it will be right as rain.
</p>

<p>
Start in any stitch around with a <strong>standing single crochet</strong> (Photo 1). 
Make a <strong>crab stitch</strong> in each stitch around (Photos 2 and 3).
</p>
    
<h2>Special Stitches</h2>

<p><strong>Tr Cluster:</strong> Tr3tog worked around front posts (not stitch tops).<br>
<strong>Standing Stitches:</strong> Standing sc, hdc, and dc to start rounds without chains.</p>   

<h2>Round 26</h2>

<p>In this round, stitches are worked around back posts. Take care not to skip or double-wrap posts.</p>

<p>Join with a standing sc around back post of any fpdc from Round 24. Bpsc next 9 st’s.</p>

<p><strong>Repeat:</strong><br>
*Bphdc in next 10 st’s (last into st before fpdc).  
Bpdc next 9 st’s.  
Make (3 bptr, ch 2, 3 bptr) in next st for corner.  
Bpdc next 9 st’s (last before fpdc).  
Bphdc next 10 st’s.  
Bpsc next 20 st’s.*  
Repeat 3 more times, omitting last 10 bpsc’s on final repeat. Join with sl st.</p>

<p><strong>Stitch Count:</strong><br>
Total: 256 st’s + 4 ch-2 spaces<br>
Per side: 64 st’s (20 bpsc, 20 bphdc, 18 bpdc, 6 bptr)</p>

<h2>Round 27</h2>

<p>If using same colour: ch 1, sc in same st, sc next 13 st’s.<br>
If using new colour: standing sc in same st as sl st join, sc next 13 st’s.</p>

    <h3>Round 28</h3>

<p>
When you make the corners in this round, they will seem too tight for the round. Do not worry about it.
</p>

<p>
Join your yarn by making a <strong>standing single crochet</strong> in any ch-3 picot around (Photo 1).
</p>

<p>
Ch 4. Make a tr cluster, working around the front posts of the 3 bptr’s in Round 26 (Photos 3 and 4). Ch 2 (Photo 5). Skip the first 4 dc’s after the bptr’s. Hdc in the next 2 stitches (indicated with an arrow in Photo 6 and illustrated in Photo 7). Ch 2, skip the next 2 stitches and hdc in the next 2 stitches. (Ch 2, skip the next 2 stitches and sc in the next 2 stitches) 9 times. (Ch 2, skip the next 2 stitches and hdc in the next 2 stitches) twice. There should now be 4 dc’s left before the bptr’s from Round 26 (Photo 8). Ch 2. Make a tr cluster by working around the front posts of the 3 bptr’s in Round 26 (Photo 9). Ch 4. Sc in the picot (Photo 10).
</p>

<p>
Repeat this sequence 3 more times, omitting the last sc on the last repeat. Join to the top of the first sc with a slip stitch. Fasten off and work away your tails of yarn.
</p>

<p>
Once you have completed the round, push the (ch-4, sc, ch-4) parts in each corner to the back of your work, never to be seen or used again (Photos 11 and 12)!
</p>

<h4>Stitch Counts</h4>

<p><strong>Total:</strong> 116 stitches, 8 ch-4 spaces, and 56 ch-2 spaces (8 tr clusters, 32 hdc’s, and 76 sc’s – including corner sc’s)</p>

<p><strong>Per Side:</strong> 29 stitches, 2 ch-4 spaces, and 14 ch-2 spaces (2 tr clusters, 8 hdc’s, and 19 sc’s – including corner sc)</p>

<h2>Round 29</h2>

<p>Most stitches are worked into Round 27, except for 16. When working into stitches under ch-2 spaces, work in front of the chains.</p>

<p>Join with a standing hdc in the second hdc from Round 28 on any side.</p>

     <img src="harmony-mandala/rnd 28.jpg" alt="Round 28">   

<p><strong>Repeat:</strong><br>
*Fptr in 2 st’s from Round 27 under next ch-2 space.  
(Ch 2, fpdc in 2 st’s from Round 27 under next ch-2 space) × 10.  
Ch 2, fptr in next 2 st’s.  
Hdc in next 2 hdc’s from Round 28.  
Ch 2, tr cluster in first 3 dc’s of half-circle.  
(Ch 4, tr cluster in next 3 dc’s) × 3.  
Ch 2, hdc in next 2 hdc’s from Round 28.*  
Repeat 3 more times, omitting last hdc on final repeat. Join with sl st.</p>

<p><strong>Stitch Count:</strong><br>
Total: 128 st’s, 12 ch-4 spaces, 52 ch-2 spaces  
(16 tr clusters, 16 hdc, 16 fptr, 80 fpdc)<br>
Per side: 32 st’s, 3 ch-4 spaces, 13 ch-2 spaces</p>    

    <h3>Round 29</h3>

<p>
Except for 16 stitches, you will be working only into the stitches of Round 27 in this round. When working into the stitches from Round 27 below the ch-2 spaces, work in front of the ch-2 spaces, not over them!
</p>

<p>
You will notice that there is a fpdc in the instructions below that has been highlighted in the original pattern. This is because a lot of people have missed the fact that those stitches should be fpdc’s, not fptr’s. If you accidentally make them fptr’s your square will simply bulge slightly.
</p>

<p>
Join your yarn by making a <strong>standing half-double crochet</strong> in the second hdc from Round 28 on any side (Photo 1).
</p>

<p>
Fptr in the 2 stitches from Round 27 directly below the next ch-2 space (Photo 2). Remember to work in front of the ch-2 space, not over it (Photo 5). (Ch 2 and fpdc in the 2 stitches from Round 27 directly below the next ch-2 space (Photos 3 and 4)) 10 times. Ch 2 and fptr around the 2 stitches from Round 27 directly below the next ch-2 space. Hdc in the next 2 hdc’s from Round 28 (Photo 6).
</p>

<p>
You will now be working into the half-circle formed by the (6 dc, picot, 6 dc) from Round 27, and in front of the ch-4 spaces from Round 28. You will have to push the “leaves” out of the way to find the first and last stitches of the half-circle (Photo 7). Ch 2 and make a tr cluster in the first 3 dc’s of the half-circle (Photos 7 and 8). (Ch 4 and make a tr cluster in the next 3 dc’s of the half-circle) three times (Photos 9 and 10). Ch 2 and hdc in the next 2 hdc’s from Round 28 (Photo 11).
</p>

<p>
Repeat this sequence 3 more times, omitting the last hdc on the last repeat. Join to the top of the first hdc with a slip stitch.
</p>

<h4>Stitch Counts</h4>

<p><strong>Total:</strong> 128 stitches, 12 ch-4 spaces, and 52 ch-2 spaces (16 tr clusters, 16 hdc’s, 16 fptr’s, and 80 fpdc’s)</p>

<p><strong>Per Side:</strong> 32 stitches, 3 ch-4 spaces, and 13 ch-2 spaces (4 tr clusters, 4 hdc’s, 4 fptr’s, and 20 fpdc’s)</p>

Repeat 3 more times, omitting final corner on last repeat. Join with sl st.</p>
